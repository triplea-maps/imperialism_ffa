== Imperialism FFA == <br>An expansion oriented scenario created by Athomahawk.        <br> a few rules are found below...   <br>   <br> A player must control Trans-Jordan to use the Suez Canal.   <br>   <br> By default battleships do not repair.   <br>   <br> #1. No attacking a capital on turn 1 of any kind is allowed, not even strategic bombing.   <br> #2. No more than five units may be placed in each territory during your bid placement phase, with the exception of placement in your capital, or placing a navy.   <br> #3. All naval units MUST be placed in a seazone adjacent to an industrial complex that you own (you may place units in seazones next to bid-purchased industrial complexes).   <br> House rules are subject to the host of the game's approval.    <br> Have fun!   <br>    <br> (Remember to place your bids in a balanced fashion...diplomacy sometimes fails!)
